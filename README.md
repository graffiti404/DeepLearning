## Neural Network Part 1: Inside the black box

### what is Neural Network?

- a neural network consists of nodes and connections between the nodes.

  [^nodes]: include Hidden Layer nodes ,input nodes ,output nodes .

  - the numbers along  each connection represent parameter values that were estimated when this neural network was fit to the data.
  - using **back propagation**(BP) to estimate unknown parameter values.

#### Activation Function

- to build blocks for fitting a squiggle to data.

- type of function

  - ReLU

  - SoftPlus(soft ReLU)

  - sigmoid

#### Hidden Layer

- layer between the input and output nodes.
